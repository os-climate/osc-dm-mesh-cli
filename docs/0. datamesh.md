## Prerequisites

- Python must be available, preferably in a virtual environment (venv).
- docker must be installed and running on your machine

## Setting up your Environment

Some environment variables are used by various source code and scripts.
Setup your environment as follows (note that "source" is used)
~~~~
source ./bin/environment.sh
~~~~

Additionally, you will need and openAI API key, which needs to be set to the following environment variable, either in
your bash profile, or system variables:

~~~
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your openAI API key>
~~~

It is recommended that a Python virtual environment be created.
We have provided several convenience scripts to create and activate
a virtual environment. To create a new virtual environment using
these convenience scripts, execute the following (this will
create a directory called "venv" in your current working directory):
~~~~
$PROJECT_DIR/bin/venv.sh
~~~~

Once your virtual enviornment has been created, it can be activated
as follows (note: you *must* activate the virtual environment
for it to be used, and the command requires "source" to ensure
environment variables to support venv are established correctly):
~~~~
source $PROJECT_DIR/bin/vactivate.sh
~~~~

Install the required libraries as follows:
~~~~
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~~

Note that if you wish to run test cases then you will need
to also install "pytest" (it is not installed by default as
it is a development rather than product dependency).
~~~~
pip install pytest
~~~~


## Starting the Ecosystem Platform

The Ecosystem Platform components interact with each other
so the simplest way to get all of them running is
to use the full Ecosystem Platform docker-compose.

The Ecosystem Platform docker compose is in a different directory
and hence must be started in a separate terminal window:


~~~~
cd $HOME_DIR/bgssrv-dm

source ./bin/environment.sh

$PROJECT_DIR/app/startd.sh
~~~~
